# Zero-Shot-Audio-Classification

Description
This project demonstrates how to perform zero-shot audio classification using the Hugging Face ðŸ¤— Transformers library. The goal is to classify audio recordings without explicit training on the target classes, leveraging pre-trained models and techniques in a zero-shot learning framework. It's designed for researchers, developers, and hobbyists interested in machine learning, audio processing, and natural language processing.

Installation
Before running the notebook, ensure you have Python installed on your system. It's recommended to use a virtual environment. Then, install the necessary dependencies as follows:

bash
Copy code
pip install transformers datasets soundfile librosa
Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Open the Audio Classsification (Zero Shot).ipynb notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
Execute the notebook cells in order, following any instructions provided within the notebook for customization or alternative operations.
The notebook includes steps to prepare your dataset, build the audio classification pipeline, and apply zero-shot classification techniques to audio data.
